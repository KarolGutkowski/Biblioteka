My high school project written in HTML, CSS , JavaScript (also AJAX to update parts od website) and PHP.
This is a basic library website that servers functionality of registering new users and logging them in
it allows users to check their account data including books they lend it also allows to lend available books.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also a search option for non-registered users that allows to lookup the details of books without the need to login.

The main page displays a random book as a book recommandation.
